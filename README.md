## About The Project

### Overview

Empress France is a well-rounded solution for regional customizations in France. It's designed to cater to businesses that require a robust, compliant, and region-specific ERP tool. This application ensures your business operations align with the latest financial laws, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

### Key Features

- **Chained Transaction Logs:** This feature automatically registers all sales and payment transactions to comply with POS software laws.
- **Le Fichier des Écritures Comptables (FEC):** This report is easily generated to fulfill the legal requirement of providing an electronic accounting journal.

Empress France is built with [Empress](https://Empress.com/), a flexible, robust, and comprehensive open-source ERP system.
